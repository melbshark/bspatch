## Usage

```java

//dependency
compile 'me.ele:bspatch:1.0.0'

//simple as this, use the code in non-main thread
int result = Patcher.patch(oldApkPath, newApkPath, patch);
```

## Tools for diff & patch 

calculate two apks's diff, you need **bsdiff**, it locates in **/tools/bsdiff**
this cli may be used in server side

```shell
 bsdiff oldfile newfile patchfile
```

you may want to check whether diff&patch works, use bspatch for verification

```shell
bspatch oldfile newfile patchfile
```

### notice

sync with jcenter maybe need some time, if library can't be found, please use my personal maven center
 
 ```groovy
  repositories {
         jcenter()
         maven {
             url "https://dl.bintray.com/jackcho/maven"
         }
     }
 ```
